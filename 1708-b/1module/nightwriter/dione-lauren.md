**Evaluator:** Victoria
**Repo:** https://github.com/BLaurenB/nightwriter
**Notes:** 
* Make sure to read the README carefully; output should be # of 'characters' like letters & symbols, not '.'s & '0's
* Work on refactoring your tests! (Get them functional & watch indenting), but overall great job testing each method & pushing for edge cases
* Way to break out a module!
* Nice use of ruby methods & not just #each loops! If you're exposing your instance variables through an attr, make sure to call the method & not use the instance var
**opportunity to move up to 3 for encapsulation if refactor long method**
