**Evaluator:** Victoria
**Repo:** https://github.com/katyjane8/night_writer
**Notes:** 
* Remember to take pry out of pushed code 
* Add some tests for edge cases 
* Make sure to thoroughly read the spec (could have played around with translated code)
* Your translator is printing the library when you write braille to a file
* Use your attr methods if you have them (avoid instance vars in code if you're already exposing them)
* Watch indenting

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

### 3. Test-Driven Development
