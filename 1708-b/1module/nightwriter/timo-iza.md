**Evaluator:** Victoria
**Repo:** https://github.com/izaxveta/night_writer/tree/completed_project
**Notes:**  
* Way to test every method in your code; work on adding edge-case testing (empty strings, extra chars, etc.)
* Watch spacing in tests & don't push skipped test to final 
* Try to avoid changing code to fit your tests
* Make sure you're submitting code from master 
* Some methods are a little long
* I like that you broke out classes according to responsibility
* Nice to break out the dictionaries; could look into making a module
* Way to use map & various Ruby methods!
* Be more explicit with naming (your method should do exactly what it's named) & don't use data structures in names

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
