Pounds of food not updating with supplies; we talked it through and identified the issue with insert

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
