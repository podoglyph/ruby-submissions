The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
