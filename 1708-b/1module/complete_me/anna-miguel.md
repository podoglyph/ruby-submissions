**Evaluator:** Victoria
**Repo:** https://github.com/anlewi5/complete_me
**Notes:** 
* Remember to split tests with setup on top & assertions @ bottom w space
* Push yourselves to consider additional classes to break out logic
* Some opportunities to refactor more logic (or clean-up unnecessary variables) but nicely broken out methods overall 
* Great test coverage to check against each method! Push to drive your code from your test & not rely on spec harness tests to tell you what to do

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

### 3. Test-Driven Development
