## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 3. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
