### Notes from Nate:

Nice work on experimenting with modules. I'm curious how you feel about your end product. I appreciate your effort to break up the logic, and your abstraction is on point, but it's come at the cost of encapsulation. Many of your modules are calling methods from other modules, which means theyâ€™re dependent on each other, which means you have not separated concerns, which means you have the dreaded "spaghetti code."

These are the kinds of conversations I wouldn't expect to have with a Mod 1 student in the first week, so you're definitely ahead of the game, but let's swing the pendulum back towards simplicity to find the right balance.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility


### 3. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
