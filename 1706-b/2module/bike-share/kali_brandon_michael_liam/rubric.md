### Notes:

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application has some small missing base functionality

### 2. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 2: Application is difficult to navigate, and may not follow RESTful conventions. This project may have limited styling.

### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/responses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

### 5. Testing

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 2: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.
