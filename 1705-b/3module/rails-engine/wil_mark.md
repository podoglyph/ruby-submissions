Notes:
* Controllers were appropriately clean
* Watch for styling consistency in indentation
* Make sure commented out stuff doesnt make it to master
* project used SQL mostly, with some AR mixed in.
* Would like to have seen more in depth model testing, project did not have
a good number of model tests and did not have BI tests.
* Spec harness has 13 failures, 2 errors
* 101 tests, 75 percent test coverage

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 1: Project fails more than 7 (10 for individual project) spec harness tests.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 2: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>70%) but does not adequately balance controller and unit tests.

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

**3. API Design**

* 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

**4. Queries**

* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.
