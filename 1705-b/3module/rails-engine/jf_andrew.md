Notes:
* Application runs, 3 missing from spec harness
* 67 tests, all passing, 35% test coverage
* Controllers generally clean, a bit could be pushed down away from serializers
and controllers to models.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 1: Project does not have 70% test coverage.

**2. Code Quality**
