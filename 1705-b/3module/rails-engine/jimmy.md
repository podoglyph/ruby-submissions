Notes:
* Spec harness fully works.
* 100 percent coverage, with 67 tests.
* Would rather have seen a method in the model that returns a random instance
instead.



### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

**3. API Design**

* 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

**4. Queries**

* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.
