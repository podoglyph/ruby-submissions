### 2. Enumerable & Collections

*   3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### 3. Test-Driven Development

*   3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

### 4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

### 5. Functional Expectations

*   2: Application is usable but has some missing functionality.
