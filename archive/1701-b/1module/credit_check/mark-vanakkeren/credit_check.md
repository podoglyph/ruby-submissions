### Assessed By: 
Ilana

### Notes:
- would like to see more refactoring into smaller methods. 

### Evaluation Rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 3. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
