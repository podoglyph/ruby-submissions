The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2.5:  Application runs but the code has long methods and needs refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2.5: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
