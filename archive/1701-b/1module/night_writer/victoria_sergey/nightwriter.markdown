- file io was broken out as well

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2.5:  Application runs but the code has long methods and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application always breaks concepts into classes and methods which encapsulate functionality.

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
