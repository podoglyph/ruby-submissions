## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
*   3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

*   3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development
*   2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.


### 4. Functional Expectations
*   2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3
