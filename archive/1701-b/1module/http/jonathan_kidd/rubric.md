## Assessor: Beth Sebian

## Notes:

* Through i3
* Strong testing suite, some nice unit testing, would benefit from more tests
* Solid style, some long methods
* Would like to see classes split up further

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

*   4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
*   3: **Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring**
*   2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
*   1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

*   4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
*   3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
*   2.5: **Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear**
*   1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 3. Test-Driven Development

*   4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
*   3: **Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.**
*   2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.
*   1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Functional Expectations

*   4: Application implements all five iterations and at least one extension
*   3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4
*   2: **Application implements iterations 0 - 3**
*   1: Application implements through interation 2 or less
