### Project Template

### Turing Wellness Tracker App

### Pitch

This app will replace the google spreadsheet Turing students currently use to track welness goals. 

### Problem

The current goal tracker is OK, not super neat and clean. It is a spreadsheet that gets the job done, but could be built in a much more user friendly way.

### Solution

As a leader of Hamilton posse, we began work on this during Mod 2... it has sat dormant since.  I would like to see this completed to a poinnt where students can use it and an Admin can gather data/stats for each week and mod. 

### Target Audience

Turing students

### New Techniques

Not sure... would love some advice here! Definitely going to be a rails app with Javascript. I would like to build in some of the things we learned about in Mod 3, but that I never really had the chance to implement (eg some kind of background worker that sends reminder texts) 

### Workflow

Waffle.io and personal notes
