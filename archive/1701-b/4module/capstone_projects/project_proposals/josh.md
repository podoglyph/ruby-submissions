# BlockValue

(I sorta hate the CamelCased start-uppy name)

### Pitch


How valuable is a given parcel of land? With BlockValue, you will be able to select a region of space, outline the productive vs. unproductive components of the land, and get projections for if it's current utilization is financially sustainable or not.

### Problem

Most of us our divorced from the costs required to sustain our lifestyle. There's a wave of [New Urbanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Urbanism) making waves, that recognizes the unsustainable nature of how America tends to do housing. (I.E. suburbs).

Most people are well-insulated from these costs, and view any change to land-use regulations as a threat to their way of life.

I'd like to make a case that by NOT reforming land use regulations, their way of life will be eventually cause financial and environmental ruin.



### Solution

I'd like to give people a tool to "paint" different pieces of their own neighborhood to decide how much income it generates compared to what it costs to maintain.

Here's an example of what that might look like:

!["painting" productive, neutral, costly portions of a neighborhood](https://cl.ly/3s2o2T3U3Q3E/Google_Maps.jpg)

We could do some math on this set-up, pull in regular infrastructure depreciation projections, make some assumptions about the state income tax generated by the homes, and graph if this neighborhood will be bankrupt in the next fifteen years or not.

I'm inspired by the way [hoodmaps](https://hoodmaps.com/new-york-city) takes user-submitted "painting" on the canvas and stores the values. His story, along with some code alongs, here: https://levels.io/hoodmaps/

### Target Audience

Non-technical but civic-minded individuals. I'd like the information this app generates to be something someone could take to a planning commission and say "$CURRENT_PLAN seems unsustainable. What do you think?"

### New Techniques

Lots of JavaScript and HTML Canvas goodies...
