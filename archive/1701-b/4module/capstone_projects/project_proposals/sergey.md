### Project Template

### Parker

### Pitch

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

* It's an app that provides a client (driver) to request a parker (person) to seat in the car that is parked at the specific address by client, while client is away (from 30min to 2 hours)

### Problem

1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.

* There is a problem with finding a parking spot in Manhattan NY. If you live in Manhattan, then you probably don't have a car or you have a personal driver. If you come to work to Manhattan with your car, then you probably have a monthly parking. But if you want to come to manhattan just for 30min to 2hours to do your business, you will spend 30min to 1hour circling around and looking for parking. And even if you find it, you still have to pay for parking and your parking spot won't be in front of the building that you are planning to go to.  

### Solution

1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.

* So the solution to this problem is that you can put your destination on a map. And on the other side of this app there is a parker who will accept your order, will be able to track your commute on a map. And will be waiting for you by your location request to take care of your car.

### Target Audience

1-3 sentences describing what type of user your app would be applicable to.

* This app has two audiences. First audience is users who live in other boroughs of NY and travel to manhattan one in a while for short trips. Second audience is employees (parkers), students and young people who are interested in additional income. 

### New Techniques

Which new techniques are you hoping to implement?

* Implement an API that will create that OAuth flow and allows the user (client) to request a parker using a lat/lon or a location on a map.
