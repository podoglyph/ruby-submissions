### Project Template

### Security Analizer

### Pitch

This (website or gem) analyzes a website (or source code) for security vulnerabilities - cross site scripting, sql injection etc and shows exactly where the vulnerability exists and then sugests how it can fix it.  I'd likely draw from OWASAP's top ten vulnerabilities: https://www.port80software.com/support/articles/2013-owasp-top-10  and look for those vulnerabilities in the scan, And ideally this would be a gem that is or an atom package maybe that would real time analyze the code being written and assess whether or not it has a vulnerabiltiy and if it does it'll pop up a window that shows the vulnerability and how to fix it. 

### Problem

There is a discontect between developers and security analyst about how to secure a companies information. So many apps are left unsecure and the fix to it is really not that difficult. 

### Solution

This tool brings the security to the beginning of path - with the developer. 

### Target Audience

Developers Mostly

### New Techniques

  - possibily using a gem 

### Workflow

  - Waffle!
