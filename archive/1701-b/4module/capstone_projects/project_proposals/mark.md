### Project Template

### [RiverRight]

### Pitch

A platform for managing the coordination of shared gear while planning a multiday raft trip.

### Problem

Planning a rafting trip requires a ton of coordination around shared gear. Typically, this coordination is achieved using spreadsheats, email, phone calls/texting, and in person planning sessions. It is very difficult to keep track of it all to ensure a successful trip.

### Solution

River Right will provide a single platform for coordinating group gear. It will display who is bringing what based on user profiles. These user profiles will be used in order to determine which gear is still needed and which is in excess, making the trip planning much more efficient.

### Target Audience

The target audience is the larger rafting community but the technology could be implemented to include planning for backpacking/camping or any type of activity that requires gear aggregation from individuals.

### New Techniques

New techniques will include building a frontend using Object Oriented JavaScript and a backend using Node/Express

### Workflow

I will be using Pivotal tracker to manage the development of my app.
