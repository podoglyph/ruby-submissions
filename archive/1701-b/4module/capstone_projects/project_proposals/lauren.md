### Lauren Oliveri Project Proposal

### Denver Bike Rack Finder [Brackr]

### Pitch

Brackr allows users to find a bike rack near them using Denver city data, navigate to those bike rack by using their current location, while also allowing citizen of Denver to crowd source the locations of new bike racks and comment or report bike rack issues to make commuting and locking up bikes safer and easier.

### Problem

When polling my roommates on what piece of technology would add value to their lives, they couldn't emphasize enough how annoying it is to bike to a location with no idea where to lock up their bike. Denver city has an index of their bike racks, but it is in a pretty inaccessible format to most and also isn't comprehensive enough or flexible enough to update in real time. 

### Solution

First, Brackr will maintain an API of bike share locations. It will know where you are (if you allow it to access your location), and recommend locations that are closest to you. It can also stay up to date by "crowdsourcing" bike rack locations that aren't included in Denver's database and any comments tied to that bike rack (maybe the bike rack is under repair?). 

### Target Audience

This targets any bikers and commuters of Denver that rely on publicly owned bike racks! It can also be used by businesses that want to advertise that their business has a bike rack. 

### New Techniques

I think at the least, I'd like to build a Rails backend (for APIs) and a Javascript front end, which utilize Google Map APIs to display data and somehow help with navigations to the bike locations. Some new technologies I'm considering implementing would be React, or maybe even React Native if I think I can make this into a mobile application. 

### Workflow

I will be using Pivotal Tracker to manage my project.
