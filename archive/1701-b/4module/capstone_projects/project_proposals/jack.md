### Project Template

### Face OAuth- Working Title: Face...book? (is this taken yet)

### Pitch
Allow users to quickly authenticate using facial recognition. Especially useful on services where a keyboard or other physical interface is impractical. 

### Problem

Authentication on IOT devices is either non existant or relies on physical (RFID cards) or knowledge (passcode) verification. Authenticating on user's physical attributes (who they are) could allow IOT devices to add quick and simple authentication for security. For example, an app that allows door locks to open for specific users, users like Airbnb, realtors, Turing's door. No need for physical key exchange, or to give out temp passwords that must be rememebered.

### Solution

Create a rails web app that allows users to enroll using a webcam. Admins can add permissions to users. API allows devices/services to authenticate users. Create a demo IOT device that authenticates on an image

### Target Audience

People with faces? Devices that might want to limit or log access. Doors, billable access things (like the Nativ bar, but skip the keycard), etc..

### New Techniques
Using the webcam to capture photos, and send it to the server. Encoding/storing images in a ways that make them easy to pass around. 

### Workflow

Big fan of Trello or Waffle. PT seems to heavy for a one man band.
