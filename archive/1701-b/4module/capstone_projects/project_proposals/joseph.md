### Project Template

### Core Values

### Pitch

Core Values helps you build and keep value-driven goals based on psychological research of willpower, habit forming, and social support.

### Problem

There are thousands of task-trackers, goal-setters, and will-power boosting apps on the market, but most completely miss the essential elements of human psychology. They treat goals as checklists without identifying the root causes of success and failure in goal-keeping and habit formation.

### Solution

Core Values changes the 'checklist' mentality into goals that reflect your values, and then supports you with habit-development, social support, and guided reflection. Users are guided through goal-setting with links and resources to performance research. My app will include standard goal setting and tracking but will also prompt social support from a list of mentors and cheerleaders for each user.

### Target Audience

People who want to change habits and track their performance on their most important values.
