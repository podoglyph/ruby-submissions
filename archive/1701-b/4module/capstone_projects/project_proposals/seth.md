### Project Template

### Imgur Favorites

### Pitch

A website that parses Imgur's api and allows you to create folders for your favorite images allowing to find specific images easier with folders and search tags

### Problem

Imgur users go through hundreds of images a day and favorite images for later use. But because there is no way for them to sort their images they eventually forget about them or can't find the specific one they want fast enough.

### Solution

I will have an easy to use site that allows people to sort their images and search for specific ones with tags they create inside their folders to quickly and easily find an image.

### Target Audience

Any imgur user.

### New Techniques

Dropdowns on image clicks to add it to a folder.

### Workflow

Waffle.io
