# Quantified Self

### Student: Sam Landfried

### Evaluated by: Schutte

#### Notes

* Great job overall 
* Could improve on SRP in JavaScript functions (esp. in front-end)
* UI was a little hard to use due to background/font colors and form fields
  being blank.
* Nice Rails-y abstraction on the back-end.
* Nice use of vanilla JS

## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- **3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**

### Planning and Design

- **4: Team created visual schema, API documentation and user stories, before writing tests. API adheres to REST standard.**

### Testing

- 3: All back-end functionality is covered by tests. Front-end uses unit tests wherever logic can be separated from interface and network requests.

- **2.5 (no front end tests)**

- 2: More back-end functionality implemented than tested and/or very little front-end testing

### HTML/UI

- **3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab
  case.**

### JS syntax and Style

- **3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of good coding practices, like DRY and separation of concerns. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**

### Git Workflow

- **4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation**

( good workflow for working solo )

### Project Management

- **3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project
  organized.**
