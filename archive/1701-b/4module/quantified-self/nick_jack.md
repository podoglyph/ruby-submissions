# Quantified Self

### Students: Nick Jacques and Jack Pincus

### Evaluated by: Schutte

#### Notes

* Solid job on this. Could definitely improve on documented code
  communication and front-end unit testing, but it's clear you all put in
  some work and learned a lot.
* Your back-end readme is missing spaces between the ## and text on the
  headers.
* Nice job organizing your functions in the front- and back-end. 
* Good back-end readme, front-end is the same as the starter pack.
* Re: [this](https://github.com/jwpincus/jwpincus.github.io/blob/master/lib/index.js#L212-L223) bit of code, reach for an Object literal when the logic is this simple.


## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- **3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**

### Planning and Design

- **3: Team created either a schema or API docs to facilitate implementation of a service.**

### Testing

- **2: More back-end functionality implemented than tested and/or very little front-end testing**

(No front-end unit tests)

### HTML/UI

- **3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.**

### JS syntax and Style

- **3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of good coding practices, like DRY and separation of concerns. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**

### Git Workflow

- **3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.**

### Project Management

- **3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.**
