# Quantified Self

### Students: Seth Moser and Brett Schwartz

### Evaluated by: Schutte

#### Notes

* The back-end repo looked really solid, looks like the front-end was the bigger obstacle.
* Your front-end repo says it's a single-page application: keep in mind that's not the case! If you have multiple `.html` files, it's a multi-page app.
* Great OOP on the back-end! Loved the MVR(outer) organization.
* I would still spend time getting this to production. It's an important problem to solve.
* Solid README's, especially on the back-end üëç.

## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- **1: Application is missing a significant portion of functionality**

* Functionality can't be considered complete if it's not in production.

### Planning and Design

- **4: Team created visual schema, API documentation and user stories, before writing tests. API adheres to REST standard.**

### Testing

- **2: More back-end functionality implemented than tested and/or very little front-end testing**

* No front-end tests

### HTML/UI

- **1: Application is unusable**

(Not on production)

### JS syntax and Style

- **3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of good coding practices, like DRY and separation of concerns. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**

### Git Workflow

- **3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.**

### Project Management

- **3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.**

* Would like to see more documented conversations about code and features.
