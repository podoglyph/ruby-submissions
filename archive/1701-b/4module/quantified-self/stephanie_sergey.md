# Quantified Self

### Students: Stephanie Bentley and Sergey Lukyanenko

### Evaluated by: Schutte

#### Notes

* Overall great project! I can tell you all worked hard and learned a lot.
* I was unable to add a food, I got a JS alert that I needed to fill inname
  and calories. When I refreshed, however, all of my attempts were on the
  page.
* Pretty pleasant app to use
* Loved seeing some GitHub conversations. Next step is to add more specific
  feedback than things like "nice!". (I'm still working on this too!).
* Didn't see migration instructions on the back-end README.
* Nice job with unit-testing the front-end!
* Think about breaking up your back-end tests to separate files next time.
* This could use some refactoring: https://github.com/lukyans/quantified-self-fe/blob/master/lib/index.js#L30-L72
* An object would be great here: https://github.com/lukyans/quantified-self-fe/blob/master/lib/index.js#L88-L91
* This seems like a good candidate for an object or array iteration pattern: https://github.com/lukyans/quantified-self-fe/blob/master/lib/index.js#L265-L295

## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- **3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**

### Planning and Design

- **3: Team created either a schema or API docs to facilitate implementation of a service.**

### Testing

- **3: All back-end functionality is covered by tests. Front-end uses unit tests wherever logic can be separated from interface and network requests.**

### HTML/UI

- **3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.**

### JS syntax and Style

- **3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of good coding practices, like DRY and separation of concerns. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**

### Git Workflow

- **4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation**

### Project Management

- **3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.**
