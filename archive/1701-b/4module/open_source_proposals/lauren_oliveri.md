### Pitch 1: [Issue.io](https://github.com/despo/issuehub.io)

* **Why:** I tried to use this nightmare of a site to find other open source projects... it was extremely difficult to use.
* **What:** The labels do not work at all in filtering, and I feel like that's not something too crazy to fix. There are a few issues open about it.
* **I Need:** to clone down the repo and get it running locally. It's written in ruby / erb, so I feel pretty comfortable about navigating the code.
* **When I'm Done:** Hoping to submit a PR, and many users are in favor of this fix. Though it doesn't look like repo has been updated in 2 years.

### Pitch 2: Ruby For Good: [Ecosystem Climate Regulation Services Calculator](https://github.com/rubyforgood/ghgvc)

* **Why:** I think the goals of this project are really important, one potential applications would be aiding in land conservation decisions by determining which areas are the most beneficial in terms of their net effect on the climate.
* **What:** There are some small design issues open that have some 'help wanted', and there's also an interesting story about exporting data into JSON, which I think would be doable!
* **I Need:** to clone down repo, and examine how they're currently exporting data into CSV to understand how I could do that for JSON.
* **When I'm Done:** Hoping to make a PR! The main contributor seems pretty active.

### Pitch 3: [Faker: RuPaul](https://github.com/stympy/faker)

* **Why:** I love Faker and I also love RuPaul. 
* **What:** There's currently a Faker for RuPaul.quotes, but it could be betrer. There's also so many other cool Fakers I could make related to RuPaul! 
* **I Need:** to clone down the repo and review some current PRs. I noticed that there are some good examples of PRs where people added cool stuff already, so it shouldn't be too difficult to emulate their work.
* **When I'm Done:** Hoping to make a PR that gets merged!

### Pitch 4: Contributing to [Breathing Games](http://breathinggames.net/?q=en)

* **Why:** In college, for my capstone design project, I constructed a device to strengthen and restore diaphragm muscle capabilities for Pompeâ€™s disease patients. Contributions include constructing the user interface and breath detection algorithm in Python on a BeagleBone microcontroller. This project is very similar to what I worked on, but way more developed!
* **What:** I reached out on their contributions page to see if they needed help, so I don't really know what I could help with and will need them to respond to my request... so we'll see.
* **I Need:** to hear back from them, and hopefully get access to their repository on GitLab.
* **When I'm Done:** This seems like a cool project, I doubt much progress will be made, but it's super relevant to the type of work I want to do after Turing!
