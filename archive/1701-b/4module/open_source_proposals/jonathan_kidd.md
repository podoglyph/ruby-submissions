### Pitch 1: Double H Ranch - Orchard

* **Why:** This nonprofit provides an important service to kids with life-threatening illnesses. I would be able to add pieces of CRUD functionality, as well as update documentation.
* **What:** https://github.com/rubyforgood/doublehranch/issues/123 looks approachable.
* **I Need:** To get an overview of the application, understand what is already there.
* **When I'm Done:** I will have added additional functionality to the application.

### Pitch 2: Diaper

* **Why:** I have not yet had the chance to find a way to export a CSV from an application, curious as to how that works.
* **What:** https://github.com/rubyforgood/diaper/issues/13 
* **I Need:** To get a sense of the application as it exists, research how to get data to export.
* **When I'm Done:** A user will be able to download a csv report.

### Pitch 3: 

* **Why:** It would be a chance to build something for the front end, where I have not spent as much time. Also, the app uses some technologies I have not been exposed to yet (Docker, R Server).
* **What:** https://github.com/rubyforgood/ghgvc/issues/8
* **I Need:** To see what the app is about, see if there will be any complications to adding a footer to the application layout.
* **When I'm Done:** The footer will be in place.
