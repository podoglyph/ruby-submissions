### Pitch 1: Put counts of each faker element in the documentation

* **Why:** I use faker alot in my projects and think it would be beneficial to know how many records were in each faker element.
* **What:** Put counts of each faker element in the documentation
* **I Need:** I need to figure out the most efficient solution to take the count of each faker element
* **When I'm Done:** The issue was just posted and I reached out the the creator of the issue to talk about the best solution. When I'm done, the Faker docs will contain the count of each element.

### Pitch 2: Add unit test to Reentry

* **Why:** Love the cause and the app is looking for open source contribs
* **What:** Add unit tests for models. Currently only some of the models are being tested at the unit level. 
* **I Need:** They are using minitest so I have to dive into using minitest on a Rails project.
* **When I'm Done:** Models will have more test coverage.

### Pitch 3: 

* **Why:** Great cause, looking for devs to help out with test coverage
* **What:** Have an open issue asking for help writing additional tests
* **I Need:** Have a choice of writing feature/model tests
* **When I'm Done:** App will have more test coverage
