### Pitch 1: Playtime (Ruby for Good) - Style Notices and Alerts

* **Why:** I like the cause and they are accepting open source contributions that I believe I can contribute to.
* **What:** The notices and alerts need to be styled, as well as refactored into the main layout. The issue report mentions adding Bootstrap as well.
* **I Need:** I need to figure out if they want Bootstrap implemented, and if I can add that to the gemfile. I also need to know the messages that they want displayed.
* **When I'm Done:** The layout and views will be more maintainable and the overall look and feel of the app will be enhanced.

### Pitch 2: ghgvc (Ruby for Good) - "Add Additional Location" Broken

* **Why:** The project sounds interesting and I'd like to help resolve a bug for them.
* **What:** A button was broken after a recent update. They need to figure out why it broke and have it restored to its original state.
* **I Need:** I need to figure out the functionality but it sounds pretty straightforward. I also need to implement a test for the feature (or figure out if the test already exists but is not passing in its current state).
* **When I'm Done:** I will have fixed a known issue for an open source project and contributed to a good cause. If done well, perhaps I could work on more issues for the project.

### Pitch 3: Justice (Ruby for Good) - Add "Log In" and "Log Out" Links

* **Why:** Once again, a great cause and the issue seems reasonable.
* **What:** I would have to add a few links to both the public site and the admin site. This would require testing and some design, which I'd like to practice.
* **I Need:** I need to know if the log in and log out features have already been implemented and I am simply adding links, or if I need to implement that functionality as well. If so, this might still be doable but I'd have to take the added time to complete this functionality into consideration as I complete the rest of this module. Also, it seems like this project might not be maintained to the same degree as the other pitches I have included, so I'd need to be able to contact the contributors in order to be able to start a discussion on this issue and have the feature merged.
* **When I'm Done:** Users will be able to log in utilizing a link in the footer, and admins will be able to log out from the admin panel.
