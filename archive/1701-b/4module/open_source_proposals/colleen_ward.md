### Pitch 1: Women Rising

* **Why:** The goal and value of the project align with my own  - pairing women with mentors
* **What:** I found a issue about adding a mentor matching waitlist https://github.com/womenrising/womenrising/issues/27 that lets mentees know that if there are no mentors currently available, they have been put on a waitlist. I think I could contribute to this feature. 
* **I Need:** To get the the application set up on my machine. I am also going to attend a meetup on 7/5 where they are discussing/working on the project. 
* **When I'm Done:** Hopefully PR gets merged in. 

### Pitch 2: Operation Code

* **Why:** I think helping any under represented group in tech to learn to code is beneficial. https://github.com/rubyforgood/operationcode_backend
* **What:** Their documentation looks pretty slim, so I think I could help add some details to the readme
* **I Need:** To get the project set up on my machine and walk through what is currently there. 
* **When I'm Done:** Submit a pr to update the readme. 

### Pitch 3: Women Rising

* **Why:** The goal and value of the project align with my own  - pairing women with mentors
* **What:** There is an issue outlined here: https://github.com/womenrising/womenrising/issues/51 that there are sometimes errors when signing up to request a mentor. 
* **I Need:** To get the the application set up on my machine. I am also going to attend a meetup on 7/5 where they are discussing/working on the project. 
* **When I'm Done:** Hopefully PR gets merged in.
