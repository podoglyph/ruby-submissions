Pitch 1:
Why:  I attended an ‘Equity Hackers’ meet-up awhile back and was really impressed with the group and their mission. Recently they have created an open source project helping to match women with other women mentors. I think this is great and would love to contribute! From them: “The website for Women Rising has become an open source project. Our goal in making this open source is to give mainly women but anyone who is looking to get into development or someone who is just looking for a project to help out with, a place to display their awesome skills as well as try to give feedback to people on their code. All this is to be done in a respectful way, any contributor should review our code of conduct at Code Of Conduct. If you have any complaints please let us know by sending an email to info@womenrising.co and we will do our best to address them!” As this is an active group, I think it would be a good choice to try and make an open source contribution, because I could get feedback in person, too. 
What:  Here is the list of issues: https://github.com/womenrising/womenrising/issues…. I would love to pick up one of these.  I’m not sure where to start or which issue to try and address, so I’d love advice! They have an upcoming meet up on the 5th, so I am hoping to get involved and identify an issue to take on. https://www.meetup.com/Equality-Hackers/events/241024090/
I Need: To clone down the repo, check out the project and the site to understand what all is taking place, choose a specific bug or issue to work on.  
When I'm Done: Ultimate goal is to have a PR merged. 
 
 
Pitch 2:
Why: I found this project, Ecosystem Climate Regulation Services Calculator, through the Ruby for Good website and given recent changes to climate policies, I would love to be able to contribute to the work they are doing. Their readme indicated a number of areas for use and potential influence. I would love to be able to contribute to this work! 
What: https://github.com/rubyforgood/ghgvc/issues  Not sure which bug to choose?!
I Need: Clone down the repo, spend time digging around the code base, choose an issue
When I'm Done: Create a PR with a some kind of fix or contribution 


Pitch 3:
Why: I also found this project through Ruby for Good, Loudoun Computer Science Initiative.  Their mission is to  “get more people interested in computer science...by exposing them to it while they are kids.” They are “build[ing] an open source version of a closed source tool for high school (and other) coding challenges. This mission is something I would like to support, so thought I would try to contribute to the project. 
What: https://github.com/rubyforgood/loudoun_codes  Perhaps I could update their readme… open issue needs a description of the project ?
I Need: I would need to really understand fully their project in order to contribute to a description of it in the readme
When I'm Done:
 
 
Another pitch- I think it would be cool to contribute to translating the rails guides… looks like they have a Spanish language version(see link below).  I’d like to see what still needs translating, or updating, if it would be something I could write, and then do it :)
