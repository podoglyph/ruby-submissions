### Pitch 1: [Ecosystem Climate Regulation Services Calculator](https://github.com/rubyforgood/ghgvc)

* **Why:** I'm interested in conservation and this project is a good opportunity to work on a brownfield project.
* **What:** Most of the issues look pretty approachable for my skill level with rails. In particular [this](https://github.com/rubyforgood/ghgvc/issues/65) issue looks approachable and worthwhile as well as provides the opportunity to work closely with the project's maintainers to determined what needs to be cleaned up.
* **I Need:** To communicate with the opener of this issue and nail down exactly what needs to be cleaned since the issue is pretty vague.
* **When I'm Done:** Submit a pull request and wait for feedback.

### Pitch 2: [PublicLab.org](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2)

* **Why:** Another environmental project that is very actively maintained and has plenty of achievable issues to solve. They also have some issues tagged "first timers only" which is encouraging. This is my favorite project of the three.
* **What:** Don't have a particular issue in mind. First timer issues get snapped up pretty quick so I could probably just watch the repo and grab one when it comes up.
* **I Need:** To watch the repo and look for a good issue to tackle
* **When I'm Done:** Have it reviewed by the projects maintainers. After reading through some of the issues they are very eager to help new contributors.

### Pitch 3: 

* **Why:** This open source project has a lot of achievable issues and is actively maintained. Larger project that has more recognition.
* **What:** [link](https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1696)
* **I Need:** I think I could get started on this pretty easily.
* **When I'm Done:**
