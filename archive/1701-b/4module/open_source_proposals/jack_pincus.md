### Pitch 1: 

* **Why:** I use faker all the time in testing. Normally I just come up with workarounds for some of the limitations, probably better to contribute to the gem rather than keep hacking it in my own code
* **What:** [This](https://github.com/stympy/faker/issues/959) is an easy docs fix to get started. New faker methods are also pretty easy to integrate
* **I Need:** To look into the ettiquette for contributing, and also dig in to some of the faking methods to see how easy it is to add in stuff.
* **When I'm Done:** The documentation and versioning errors are issues that continually pop up. The work arounds are documented in the issues. I would imagine this kind of housekeeping would be integrated quickly 

### Pitch 2: 
* **Why:** [This](https://github.com/rubyforgood/doublehranch) is a relatively simple web app made with Ruby for Good in rails. There are a lot of simple and easy bug fixes [like this](https://github.com/rubyforgood/doublehranch/issues/90). This project is very active as well
* **What:** Go after some of the low hanging fruit tagged beginner friendly.
* **I Need:** Not a whole lot. A lot of their bugs are styling or basic rails functionality
* **When I'm Done:** The community seems very active. Styling changes are easy and wuick to get reviewed

### Pitch 3: 

* **Why:** Working on tools to make climate change better understood can only be a good thing. [This](https://github.com/rubyforgood/ghgvc) is a calculator that helps show impacts of ecosystems on climate regulation based on research done by the Smithsonian
* **What:** lots of housekeeping like [this](https://github.com/rubyforgood/ghgvc/issues/23)
* **I Need:** Dig in to what some of the easier issues are. And understand what needs to be done
* **When I'm Done:** It looks like there is at least one very active contributor. I think that since this is a web app any PRs that pass testing get implemented immediately.
