# Open Source Proposal Template

You're expected to submit *three* open source proposals. Each proposal should include the project you're considering contributing to, why you're interested in it, what you'll actually be contributing, what you need to contribute, and what the result will be when you're done. See an example below:

## Example:

### Pitch 1: Contributing to VCR

* **Why:** I use VCR regularly in projects, am interested in HTTP details, and would like to dig in deeper.
* **What:** I found a feature request at http://github.com/vcr/vcr/issues/1 that sounds approachable. It asks for VCR requests to add support for the X-AUTH header.
* **I Need:** to dig into VCR and get the dev setup running locally. I need to read about X-AUTH to understand more about how it's used and the format.
* **When I'm Done:** In the original GitHub issue it sounds like the developers are in favor of the feature, so I think I can get this accepted for the next version of the library.
