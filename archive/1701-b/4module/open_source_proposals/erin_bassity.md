### Contributing to Coyote

* **Why:** My mentor is a lead on the project and invited me to contribute to it. I am quite interested in this project because my professional background includes work in arts administration and because I care about accessibility.
* **What:** Coyote is a project that museums can whitelabel (at no cost) and expand accessibility of museum collections to the sight impaired and other populations. The project involves giving museums a tool to catalogue their collections and include both alt-text descriptions of 20â€“30 words as well as much longer descriptions particularly of collection works.
* **I Need:** (1) To address comments on my first pull request so it can be merged, (2) then get to work on a feature that will allow museum staff to better access and sort collections by various criteria, (3) then complete documentation for the bug fix and feature (as well as update the readme to reflect a better setup process for new developers), and finally (4) write a blog post about the entire experience.
* **When I'm Done:** I will have contributed documentation to make it easier for other developers to get Coyote up and running for additional museums, fixed a development bug related to initial setup (current PR I need to address), added functionality currently desired by museum staff regarding sorting collections by various criteria, and published a blog post about the entire experience.
