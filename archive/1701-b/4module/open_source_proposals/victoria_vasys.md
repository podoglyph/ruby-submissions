### Pitch 1: Ecosystem Climate Regulation Services Calculator (https://github.com/rubyforgood/ghgvc/issues)

* **Why:** I'm highly interested in systems & studied ecosystems & climate throughout college; it would be super cool to get to contribute to a project that has the potential to impact education, sustainability, conservation & policy related to climate change.
* **What:** I could probably tackle issues #65 (cleanup empty scaffolded files & folders), #63 ("Add Additional Location" broken), and #23 (Move ecosystem fact sheets out of asset folder), and #8 (add a nice footer)
* **I Need:** I need to setup the project on my machine & dig a little deeper into what lives where. I would also probably start messages on each issue to make sure others aren't already tackling the problems.
* **When I'm Done:** If my prs aren't merged within a few days, I'd send a message in the issue?

### Pitch 2: Growstuff (https://github.com/growstuff/growstuff/issues)

* **Why:** I've been an avid sustainable gardener/farmer for years & would love to eventually contribute something useful to the community; this would be a great place to get my feet wet & start exploring what tools are already available.
* **What:** I could probably tackle #1100 (weird layout on garden photos), #1070 (make fb login splash image less blurry), #1107 (cannot find photo constants) & #1351 (quick plant form)
* **I Need:** I need to fork & clone & open communication about current status
* **When I'm Done:** Hopefully someone will merge my prs! Otherwise I'll be adament about messaging.

### Pitch 3: Pantry Scheduler (https://github.com/rubyforgood/pantry_scheduler)

* **Why:** Food pantries are essential for many people! It'd be nice to give to those in need.
* **What:** I could work on #86 (label cell & home phone on checkin page) & #84 (date picker)
* **I Need:** Same as above
* **When I'm Done:** Same as above
