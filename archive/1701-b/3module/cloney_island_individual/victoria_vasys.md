## Cloney Island Sprint 1 - Individual Evaluations

### Notes

### Client Expectations

Student delivered user story agreed upon with client.

- 4: Better than expected

* Messages in chat persist!!!!

### Test Quality

Story is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?

- 3: As expected

* There could be more testing on the models (validations and methods) so keep that in mind!

### Code Quality

Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.

- 3: As expected

* There is a little bit of logic in the view that could be pulled into the controller (conversations index). Really nice job, overall!
