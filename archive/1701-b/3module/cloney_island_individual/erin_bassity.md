## Cloney Island Sprint 1 - Individual Evaluations

### Notes

### Client Expectations

Student delivered user story agreed upon with client.

- 3: As expected

### Test Quality

Story is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?

- 4: Better than expected

* Really thorough testing, nice work!!

### Code Quality

Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.

- 3: As expected

* Some refactoring in places like the project model. I would like to see the service initialized so that you could potentially use it for other calls. Really nice job, overall!
