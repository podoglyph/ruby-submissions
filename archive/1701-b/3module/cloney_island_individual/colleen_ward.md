## Cloney Island Sprint 1 - Individual Evaluations

### Notes

### Client Expectations

Student delivered user story agreed upon with client.

- 4: Better than expected

* The documentation for your endpoints and the progress you made was awesome!

### Test Quality

Story is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?

- 3: As expected

* Could use testing for more than just the id to be in the json response. Would want to see other attributes checked for a 4.

### Code Quality

Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.

- 3: As expected

* Would love to see this in ActiveRecord. I would also suggest breaking out more serializers for endpoints with data that you would want to display. For example, right now, `most revenue` endpoint has the id and name of the user with the most revenue but does not display how much revenue the user has. This would push it to a 4! Really nice job, overall!
