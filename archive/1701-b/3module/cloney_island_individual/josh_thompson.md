## Cloney Island Sprint 1 - Individual Evaluations

### Notes

### Client Expectations

Student delivered user story agreed upon with client.

- 3: As expected

### Test Quality

Story is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?

- 1: Well below expectations

* Did I miss the tests for the charts? I know that you got a late start on your feature but do not sacrifice testing.

### Code Quality

Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.

- 3: As expected

* Some refactoring could be done and I would like to see the use of a serializer instead of passing in a hash to render as json.
