* https://github.com/glassjoseph/grab_bag/pull/39

### Client Expectations

Student delivered user story agreed upon with client.

- 4: Better than expected
- **3: As expected**
- 2: Below expectations
- 1: Well below expectations

_Admin functionality was implemented as agreed upon._

### Test Quality

Story is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?

- 4: Better than expected
- **3: As expected**
- 2: Below expectations
- 1: Well below expectations

_I don't see tests covering the functionality for an admin to make another user an admin. This is one big way to improve this score._

### Code Quality

Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.

- 4: Better than expected
- **3: As expected**
- 2: Below expectations
- 1: Well below expectations

_The code is of high quality. I like the AdminsHelper module to help clean up your views. I would have liked to see the admin functionality namespaced to "Admin" rather than just the route as "/admin/users" - by namespacing you imrpove the organization of your code. Someone reading your code base can easily see what functionality is scoped to an admin._
