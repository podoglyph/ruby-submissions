## Cloney Island Sprint 1 - Individual Evaluations

### Notes

### Client Expectations

Student delivered user story agreed upon with client.

- 1: Well below expectations

* Demo'd a different feature 

### Test Quality

Story is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?

- 3: As expected

### Code Quality

Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.

- 3: As expected

* Would like to see a JS file that is referenced from the html instead of pure JS right in the HTML.
