## Cloney Island Sprint 1 - Individual Evaluations

### Notes

### Client Expectations

Student delivered user story agreed upon with client.

- 4: Better than expected

* Really nice work with an unfamiliar topic!

### Test Quality

Story is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?

- 3: As expected

* Would like to see more of a stretch to test the message controller and/or at least validations on the new models.

### Code Quality

Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.

- 3: As expected

* Quite a few unused else statements. Some small refactoring but overall, nice job!
