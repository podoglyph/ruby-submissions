## Cloney Island Sprint 1 - Individual Evaluations

### Notes

See PR notes here https://github.com/glassjoseph/grab_bag/pull/43#pullrequestreview-40547768.

### Client Expectations

Student delivered user story agreed upon with client.

- 4: Better than expected
- 3: As expected 
- 2: Below expectations
- **1: Well below expectations**

_The app is currently broken so I can not see the functionality on production. Additionally, the story that was agreed upon was not delivered. Another piece of functionality was delivered. I would have liked to hear ahead of the deadline that you were not on track to deliver the agreed upon story to reset my expectations._

### Test Quality

Story is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?

- 4: Better than expected
- **3: As expected**
- 2: Below expectations 
- 1: Well below expectations 

### Code Quality

Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.

- 4: Better than expected
- **3: As expected**
- 2: Below expectations 
- 1: Well below expectations
