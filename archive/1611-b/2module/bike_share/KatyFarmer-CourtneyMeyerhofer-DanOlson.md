## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

### 2. ActiveRecord

* 4: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.

### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 3.5: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3.5: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

### 5. Testing

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
