## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
