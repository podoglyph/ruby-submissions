The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2.5:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
