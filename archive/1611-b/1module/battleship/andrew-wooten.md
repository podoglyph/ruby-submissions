Notes:
- It worked, kind of buggy
- talked about refactoring and where some logic should live
- talked about how to normalize data


### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

### 4. REPL Interface

* 2: Application's REPL has some inconsistencies or rough edges

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

### 6. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
