Notes:
- Needs significant refactoring and test coverage was not what we wanted
- talked about how to make it more dry 


### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 4. REPL Interface

* 2: Application's REPL has some inconsistencies or rough edges

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

### 6. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
