### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together
