Notes:
- testing was a little bit of a struggle, had a hard time figuring out how to test in a robust way. talked about how to set information so it is easier to manage and manipulate.
- talked about some refactoring that could have been done and the use of instance variables. 
- ran encrypt and decrypt, working on crack.

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
