Notes:

* 27 tests, all passing
* application encrypts, but does not decrypt or crack
* some overuse of attr_accessor
* File IO stuff could be broken out to separate class
* some stuff in Enigma could be broken out to a separate class


### 1. Overall Functionality

* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style


* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development


* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
