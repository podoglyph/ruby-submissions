Notes:
* 3 solid testing files, would like to see additional 2 test files to cover all 5 classes
* Testing assertions and overall testing suite solid
* Only encrypt works, not able to take multiple arguments
* Style strong, some really strong use of enumerables (incl nesting); overall very readable code
* Clear, consistent breakdown of responsibilities

### 1. Overall Functionality
* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
