Notes:
* Only encrypt works
* Style across project pretty strong
* Some gaps in testing, in general suite is pretty strong
* Solid division of responsibilities across classes and methods

### 1. Overall Functionality
* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
