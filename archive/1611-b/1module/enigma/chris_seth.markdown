Notes:
* ten tests, passing 2 not passing
* there is no Enigma class
* Decrupt and Encrypt class has a lot of code repetition, would like to have seen them treated as runners
* Character map should be pulled out to separate class,
* Application does not function
* 


### 1. Overall Functionality

* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.


### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
