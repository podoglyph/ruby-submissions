Notes:
* Application does not run
* some issues with edge cases and deeper testing
* overall code was written well, just crashed
* some opportunities to break out things into separate objects, 
* started to head in that direction, just didnt finish.

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
