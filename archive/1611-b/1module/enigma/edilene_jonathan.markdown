Notes:
- got through crack and an extension
- talked about division of responsibility 
- tests are working but only if code is commented out (we talked about commented out code to make things work)
- tests need to be more robust

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
