Notes:

* 17 tests, all pass
* application sucessfully encrypts, decrypts, does not crack successfully
* Some replication of code in encrypt/decrupt


### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations


### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components


* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
