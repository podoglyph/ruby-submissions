Notes:
* Functionality in place for all three functions, but project broke with some last-minute merge issues
* Testing suite has good content, but many test broken due to merge issue. 
* Ruby style solid. Some additional opportunities to refactor, but strong work in many classes
* Clear division of responsibilities across classes and methods


### 1. Overall Functionality
* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
