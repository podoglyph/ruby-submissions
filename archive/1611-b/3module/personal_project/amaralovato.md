GO LOCAL

Pitch

Buy Local is a moto that have been revalorized lately and many people is passionate about it. But how to find local products when the time comes?
Go Local provide this information for you selecting the best quality products and services in your region. 

Problem

There is no website that provide info about local producers/service providers for specific needs.

Solution

I want to create an online catalog that would be searchable so you can look for diverse products and services from customized puppets to award winning wines.

Target Audience

Anyone that is willing to contribute to local economies and look for quality products/services.

Integrations

I will be creating my own API and I'd like to implement Google Maps API to display local businesses on a map.
