### Pitch

Educreddit is a place for lively debate, discussion, and discovery on current events, politics, hot topics, and all things that bring education to the world. Educreddit as the name suggests works like reddit where you can comment and discuss in a forum format, but the twist is that those with an education or a background of some kind get a preference of those that don’t one a subject. Journalists can also write articles here in the galaxy of current events and news, and those articles can be discussed on.

### Problem

News sources are great to become informed on a topic, and don’t get me wrong there are comments on the articles posted. And on another hand there is great discussion on reddit in the current_event-esque pages, but there is noway to know if the person saying a thing actually knows what they are talking about or they are kinda just trying to discuss it and nomore.

### Solution

This website will solve that problem, allowing discuss on topics and articles. People also have the option the declare there identity or not as guest can comment on anything they want, they can also contribute information to the writers to talk about; however they wouldn’t be allowed to post articles until they sign up or login as a author.

### Target Audience

Reddit users interested in current events, and people with backgrounds in certain topics; also people without backgrounds who are interested in learning more; as well as journalist interested in educating the community
