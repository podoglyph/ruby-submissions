# Project Description

## BreweryUsersResearchRelaxationandRallyPoint
## Pitch
The applications will allow people nationwide to discover breweries and beers in their area as well as connect with friends through a mutual love of good beer and fun experiences.
## Problem
At this time, there is not a cool dedicated resource or application that provides people the opportunity to browse the offerings of breweries in their area, nor is there an application which offers people the opportunity to connect with others through this shared affinity.
## Solution
This application will serve as a resource that will act primarily as an information source as well as
offering the functionality to connect with other
individuals through this mutual hobby. It will allow users to browse the offerings at breweries in their area, plan trips with friends, and post reviews and comments about their experiences.
## Target Audience
The application will cater to beer enthusiasts as well as those who are merely curious and want to learn more about various beverages/breweries. These individuals are social, outgoing, and passionate about their love of good beer.
## Integrations
Which APIs will you use?
At present, I plan to make use of the BreweryDB API; although, I am in the process of brainstorming features which will require the implementation of other APIs such as Twitter and a map API.
* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
I plan to use Facebook OAuth.
