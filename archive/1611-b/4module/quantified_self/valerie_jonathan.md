## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- 4: Application implements all functionality as defined, with no bugs, and one extension
- **3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**
- 2: Application is missing required functionality, deviates significantly from the spec, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable
- 1: Application is missing a significant portion of functionality

_You did not achieve full functionality, but you communicated your timeline near the end of project. In the future, I encourage you to communicate your timeline throughout the entire project. I also notice a lot of existing code that could be functional, yet it doesn't work in production. I'd love to hear why it seems like you have more functionality than is actually working._

_Valerie still has a 1 for this rubric item due to the requested reflection not being submitted._

### Planning and Design

- 4: Team created visual schema, API documentation and user stories, before writing tests. API adheres to REST standard.
- 3: Team created either a schema or API docs to facilitate implementation of a service.
- **2: Team has some notes on how to implement their service, but someone else couldn't implement it.**
- 1: Team did not design their service.

_The project does not have API documentation to provide someone with the resources/knowledge to use your API._

### Testing

- 4: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests.
- 3: All back-end functionality is covered by tests. Front-end uses unit tests wherever logic can be separated from interface and network requests.
- **2: More back-end functionality implemented than tested and/or very little front-end testing**
- 1: Team fails to effectively test the application.

_I don't see any frontend tests, which is alright. I see a good amount of backend tests but when running them on my machine, quite a few of them fail. If this is a fluke and you have them all passing, please let me know and we can talk about this score._

### HTML/UI

- 4: Team put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes and data attributes for DOM traversal.
- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.
- **2: HTML is greatly lacking in standards compliance. UI is confusing or very buggy.**
- 1: Application is unusable

_The application is styled, but the formatting is wonky and I can't actually interact with any part of the application (besides changing the date). I can't evaluate you on your UI because there isn't really any user interaction that can take place._

### JS syntax and Style

- 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate
- **3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**
- 2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.
- 1: Team has not applied any style concepts from class or from Ruby background

_Your backend code looks really solid. You've divided it into files and followed conventions. There's room for improvement with your frontend code. You can definitely make it more OO in many different ways - the first thing I'd suggest is keeping each function single responsibility. You have quite a few functions that are doing more than one thing. The more single responsibility your functions are, the easier they will be to test._

### Git Workflow

- 4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation
- **3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.**
- 2: Team fails to use feature branches, or isn't using pull requests
- 1: All code is committed to master

_I don't see you each commenting on each other's PR's as much as I'd like. Github is a great place to document conversations about your code. That being said, you did create PR's and tag myself in some of them to ask for feedback._

### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.
- 3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.
- **2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently. Many cards have no changes made to them**
- 1: Team failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.

_I see estimated stories on your Pivotal Tracker, but I don't see any accepted stories. If you can give me an overview of how you utilized Pivotal Tracker to manage this project, I'm happy to increase this score._
