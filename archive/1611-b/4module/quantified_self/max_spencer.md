## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- 4: Application implements all functionality as defined, with no bugs, and one extension
- **3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**
- 2: Application is missing required functionality, deviates significantly from the spec, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable
- 1: Application is missing a significant portion of functionality

_You did not achieve full functionality, but you communicated your timeline continuously throughout the project._

### Planning and Design

- 4: Team created visual schema, API documentation and user stories, before writing tests. API adheres to REST standard.
- 3: Team created either a schema or API docs to facilitate implementation of a service.
- **2: Team has some notes on how to implement their service, but someone else couldn't implement it.**
- 1: Team did not design their service.

_The project does not have API documentation to provide someone with the resources/knowledge to use your API._

### Testing

- 4: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests.
- **3: All back-end functionality is covered by tests. Front-end uses unit tests wherever logic can be separated from interface and network requests.**
- 2: More back-end functionality implemented than tested and/or very little front-end testing
- 1: Team fails to effectively test the application.

_Even though you didn't really get to frontend testing, you made a solid effort to get it up and running and setup. Your backend tests looks good!_

### HTML/UI

- 4: Team put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes and data attributes for DOM traversal.
- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.
- **2: HTML is greatly lacking in standards compliance. UI is confusing or very buggy.**
- 1: Application is unusable

_When I first opened your app, I wasn't sure how to test the required functionality. I then clicked on one of the food names and saw the functionality. It isn't easy to understand how to work your application. It's also a little buggy - the alert wouldn't stop popping up at one point._

### JS syntax and Style

- 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate
- **3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**
- 2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.
- 1: Team has not applied any style concepts from class or from Ruby background

_There is room for improvement here, but in general, you've attempted to break things down and write clean code. You're following JS conventions and did your best to implement OOP. You can break some of your functions down further to make them more single responsibility._

### Git Workflow

- 4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation
- **3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.**
- 2: Team fails to use feature branches, or isn't using pull requests
- 1: All code is committed to master

_You're using git and PR's for each feature.  You're commenting on PR's and giving each other feedback. I would like to see you commit more often in the future!_

### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.
- 3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.
- 2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently. Many cards have no changes made to them
- 1: Team failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.
