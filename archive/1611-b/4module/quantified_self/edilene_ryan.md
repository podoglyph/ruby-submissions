## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- 4: Application implements all functionality as defined, with no bugs, and one extension
- 3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect
- **2: Application is missing required functionality, deviates significantly from the spec, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable**
- 1: Application is missing a significant portion of functionality

_I know you broke things near the very end of this project and didn't have time to fully fix everything. There are some bugs with keeping track of the calories and creating a new food. Because you communicated this prior to turning the project in, if you spend some time getting everything back to where it is, I'm happy to increase this score._

### Planning and Design

- 4: Team created visual schema, API documentation and user stories, before writing tests. API adheres to REST standard.
- 3: Team created either a schema or API docs to facilitate implementation of a service.
- **2: Team has some notes on how to implement their service, but someone else couldn't implement it.**
- 1: Team did not design their service.

_The project does not have API documentation to provide someone with the resources/knowledge to use your API._

### Testing

- 4: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests.
- **3: All back-end functionality is covered by tests. Front-end uses unit tests wherever logic can be separated from interface and network requests.**
- 2: More back-end functionality implemented than tested and/or very little front-end testing
- 1: Team fails to effectively test the application.

_Even though you didn't really get to frontend testing, backend tests look solid and robust. Good job_

### HTML/UI

- **4: Team put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes and data attributes for DOM traversal.**
- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.
- 2: HTML is greatly lacking in standards compliance. UI is confusing or very buggy.
- 1: Application is unusable

_Application is styled and easy to use. You structured your html and css in a well-organized way._

### JS syntax and Style

- 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate
- **3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**
- 2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.
- 1: Team has not applied any style concepts from class or from Ruby background

_You did a great job extracting pieces of logic out into individual, smaller functions. Your backend code base looks very clean. Your frontend code base has room for improvement. You have a lot of debuggers, console.log's, and a few functions that live in more than one place. I highly suggest going back and cleaning these things up._

### Git Workflow

- 4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation
- **3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.**
- 2: Team fails to use feature branches, or isn't using pull requests
- 1: All code is committed to master

_You're using PR's, but I don't see that you're commenting on each other's PR's or even "approving" all of them. I think this is something you should work on!_

### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.
- 3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.
- **2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently. Many cards have no changes made to them**
- 1: Team failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.

_I don't see most stories estimated or even started in your Pivotal Tracker. I don't see that you're updating the cards and using Pivotal as a project management tool._
