### 1. Project Management

*   4: Tracker also documents feature related discussions
*   **3: Team is using well formatted user stories and moving cards through each status in realtime**
*   2: Team has used Tracker as a respository of information
*   1: Tracker shows little to no use

Good user stories that are easy to understand.  I saw a feature as done that deals with input for the sentiment analysis giving me an alert that the input was too big.  I wasn't able to trigger the alert.  

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   4: Team is proactive in understanding scope and is able to commit to stories before starting the sprint
*   **3: Team is able to set and update expectations so that there are no surprises on the last day of the sprint**
*   2: Team does not have agreed upon stories completed at the end of the sprint, but has a plan to get them done
*   1: Team does not have agreed upon stories completed, and has no plan to complete theme

Team had clear communications on expectation and if they we're not able to deliver on stories.  Earlier than the night before would have been nice but with the compressed time table because of the holiday weekend seems fine.

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
*   **3: Project exhibits maintainable well divided code. Developers are able to speak to architecture and implementation decisions.**
*   2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or developers cannot defend their decisions.
*   1: Project demonstrates poor factoring and/or understanding of MVC.

There are some misplaced classes(Tone could maybe be in lib and not it the models folder) and some spaghetti code `Tone.get` but overall things are partioned out well.  Application generally follows good MVC practices and ruby conventions.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Project has implemented two or more major techniques that were new this week.
*   **3: Project has implemented one major technique that was new this week.**
*   2: Project has a implementation in progress of one major technique that has not been previously attempted.
*   1: Project does not implement new techniques.

### 5. Documentation

*   4: Project also features a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor
*   3: Project features easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application
*   2: Project features barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running
*   **1: Project has insufficient documentation**

There is no documentation

### 6. Accessibility

*   4: Team has expertly implemented features to follow accessibility best practices.
*   ** 3: Team has implemented code to increase accessibility.**
*   2: Team has considered accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them.
*   1: Team has not considered accessibility issues.
