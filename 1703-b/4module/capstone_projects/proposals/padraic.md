### Project Template

### A Foray into Machine Learning with TensorFlow

### Pitch

The bar of entry into Machine Learning (ML) is high, which is why this project is worthwhile in that it will demonstrate the path a software developer can take in order to use ML algorithms in a web app.

### Problem

Too many people are fully employed in, or spend too much time doing, repetitive, menial tasks. Machine Learning offers automation of these tasks so that humanity can engage in more challenging, provocative, and socially beneficial pursuits.

### Solution

This application will demonstrate how ML classifiers (identifying objects as part of a particular class) can be used in innovative and novel ways (hopefully).

### Target Audience

The final app is as yet undecided, so I don't have a target audience.

### New Techniques

Which new techniques are you hoping to implement?

This project will require the use of Python 3, TensorFlow, and various Machine Learning techniques and algorithms.

### Workflow

Pivotal Tracker fo sho.
