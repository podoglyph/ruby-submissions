_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

**   2: Developer has a mental vision for the project iterations, shows some use of a tracker tool, and uses Git effectively **   -- The scope of the project changed in the middle and I wasn't able to connect all the pieces.

### 2. Completion & Pace

**   2: Developer implements very little of the planned sprint **
     --There are many pieces, but they didn't come together into a final application.

### 3. Implementation Quality

**   2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or developers cannot defend their decisions **
     -- It's all Python and a Python web framework that started out easy and then became increasingly difficult.

### 4. Application of Techniques

**   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s) **
     -- Python and related libraries, Flask, Virtualenv, Jupyter Notebook, Google Machine Learning API.

### 5. Documentation

**   1: Developer provides insufficient documentation **
     -- Too much other stuff going on and documentation was left out.

### 6. Accessibility

**   2: Developer considers accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them **
     -- I'm aware of the issues, but again, the project got too complicated with the new tech.

### Evaluated By:

### Notes:

* Process improvements: used to just bang head on problems without taking a
  step back. With this project, learned and read a lot before
  implementation. Feeling good about machine learning theory.
* Building a machine learning solution. Learned that is a time intensive and
  in high demand.

* Updates for graduation: Accessibility boost, documentation boost

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   **2: Developer has a mental vision for the project iterations, shows some use of a tracker tool, and uses Git effectively**

Delivered code was well planned and managed, but deviated heavily from
expectations.

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   **2: Developer implements very little of the planned sprint**

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   **3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions**

MVC patterns where applicable. Well organized.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   **4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)**

* Python, Flask, machine learning algorithms.

### 5. Documentation

*   **2: Developer provides barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running**

* decent start with a template, more specificity needed.

### 6. Accessibility

*   **2: Developer considers accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them**

Simple UI for readability.
