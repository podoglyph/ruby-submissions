_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   4: Developer has a highly detailed iteration map, sophisticated organization in their tracker tool, and exceptional Git workflow
*   3: Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)
**   2: Developer has a mental vision for the project iterations, shows some use of a tracker tool, and uses Git effectively **   -- The scope of the project changed in the middle and I wasn't able to connect all the pieces.
*   1: Developer shows little evidence of project planning and management

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   4: Developer delivers the stories they committed to before starting the sprint
*   3: Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way
**   2: Developer implements very little of the planned sprint **
     --There are many pieces, but they didn't come together into a final application.
*   1: Developer does not plan or complete sprint

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well tested (where applicable) and maintainable code
      * for topics outside of BE curriculum, developer can speak to best practices applied
*   3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions
**   2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or developers cannot defend their decisions **
     -- It's all Python and a Python web framework that started out easy and then became increasingly difficult.
*   1: Project demonstrates poor factoring and/or understanding of general programming principles such as MVC and OOP

### 4. Application of Techniques

**   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s) **
     -- Python and related libraries, Flask, Virtualenv, Jupyter Notebook, Google Machine Learning API.
*   3: Developer implements four new techniques or patterns
*   2: Developer implements 3 or less major techniques that have not been previously attempted
*   1: Developer does not implement new techniques

### 5. Documentation

*   4: Developer also adds a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor
*   3: Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application
*   2: Developer provides barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running
**   1: Developer provides insufficient documentation **
     -- Too much other stuff going on and documentation was left out.

### 6. Accessibility

*   4: Developer expertly implements features to follow accessibility best practices
*   3: Developer implements code to increase accessibility
**   2: Developer considers accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them **
     -- I'm aware of the issues, but again, the project got too complicated with the new tech.
*   1: Developer does not consider accessibility issues
